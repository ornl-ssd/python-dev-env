### What is the Jupyter Notebook?

Please follow [this link](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.ipynb)
for a brief overview of Jupyter Notebook.

> ## Launching the Notebook
>
> The Jupyter notebook is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a 
> web browser. The Notebook can be executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access or can be installed 
> on a remote server and accessed through the internet.
>
> The Jupyter notebook application can be launched by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):
>
>~~~
>jupyter notebook
>~~~
>{: .bash}
>
> This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the notebook dashboard. When started, 
> the Jupyter notebook app can only access files in the current directory (or any sub-directories) when
> it was launched. If you store the notebook documents in a different directory, you need will need
> to change to that directory (or a parent directory) before launching the app.
