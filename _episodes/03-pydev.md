PyDev is an Eclipse-based development environment for Python programs. It provides a commercial-quality
environment for working on any size Python development projects. The main features provided by PyDev include:

* Syntax highlighting
* Code formatting
* Code completion
* Code analysis
* Type hinting
* Refactoring
* Visual debugging
* Unittest integration
* Code coverage

In addition, because PyDev is built using Eclipse, it also has available many of the development tools that
are integrated with the Eclipse environment, such as C/C++, Git, and modeling tools.

### Configuring PyDev

After starting Eclipse and selecting a workspace where your files will be kept (the default one is fine), you are
now almost ready to create your first project. Before doing this, however, we have to set up PyDev so that it knows
about your Python installation. This is particularly important if you've installed a new version, such as Anaconda,
in a non-standard location.

To start, we're going to first switch to the PyDev *perspective*, which is an arrangement of views and windows that
are designed to assist Python development. To do this, go to the **Quick Access**  box in the top right corner, and 
type "pydev". Choose the PyDev perspective from the list.

If this is the first time you've used PyDev, then you may see a dialog pop up like the one below:

Don't panic! This is just PyDev telling you that it needs to configure the Python environment.
