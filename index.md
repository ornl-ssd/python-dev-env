A development environment is a tool or set of tools that allow developers to
create, execute, debug, and test programs.  As Python is 
an interpreted language, the simplest development environment for Python is the 
interpreter itself. The Python interpreter provides an interactive mode that can be used to execute small
programs, view program state, visualize data, and debug programs. For complex Pythom
programs, a more sophistocated environment is required. In this lesson, we will look at a number
of development environments specifically aimed at Python development:

* IPython - An enhancment of the interpreter that provides an interactive shell to allow
mult-line editing, and includes a variety of features such as syntax highlighting,
input history, and output caching
* Jupyter Notebooks - Combined with IPyton, provides a web application that allows the creation 
and sharing of documents containing live code, equations, and visualizations.
* PyDev - A fully-fledged integrated development environment that manages project creation, editing,
execution, and debugging, as well as providing integration with Git and other version control systems.
